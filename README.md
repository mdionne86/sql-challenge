## 1. Database Creation
First, I designed the schema using www.quickdatabasediagrams.com. I've been using draw.io to design schemas at work, but this is far superior (though I guess it should be since it requires a subscription and draw.io is free!).

Second, I created the SQL scripts to: 
1. Create the tables 
2. Define the primary keys (PK), foreign keys (FK), and composite keys
3. Import data (not scripted, used the GUI)

I created the tables with PKs only first, then I created the tables with FKs second.
## 2. Analysis

The analysis consisted of sql queries using JOINS when neccesary. 
## 3. Plots
Pulling it into python was relatively straightforward by following the provided documentation. I decided to only pull the data from the database that I needed, which required a 3 table join.
